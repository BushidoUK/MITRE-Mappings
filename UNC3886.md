# UNC3886
- Also known as CAULDRON PANDA
- Suspected to be a China-nexus APT group per Mandiant attribution
> [!NOTE]
> Mandiant has not identified any technical overlaps between activities by `UNC3886` and those publicly reported by other parties as `Volt Typhoon` or `Salt Typhoon`

| ATT&CK ID |	Activity Description | Observables | 
|---|---|---|
| T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application | The attacker has used exploits in Fortinet devices, such as FortiGate, FortiManager, and FortiAnalyzer. | `CVE-2022-41328` |
| T1078: Valid Accounts | UNC3886 gained privileged access to a Juniper router from a terminal server used for managing network devices using legitimate credentials. | N/A |
| T1059.008: Command and Scripting Interpreter: Network Device CLI | UNC3886 entered the FreeBSD shell from the Junos OS CLI. | N/A |
| T1140: Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information | UNC3886 used Base64 encoding to conceal a compressed archive containing malicious binaries, which was later decoded and extracted for execution. | A Base64-encoded file `ldb.b64` was decoded into a compressed archive `ldb.tar.gz`, which was then decompressed and extracted to reveal malicious binaries. |
| T1055.009: Process Injection: Proc Memory | UNC3886 was able to circumvent this protection by injecting malicious code into the memory of a legitimate process. | UNC3886 injected malicious payloads into a newly spawned `cat` process. |
| T1036.005: Masquerading: Match Legitimate Name or Location | UNC3886 used a TINYSHELL-based active backdoor which mimicked a legitimate binaries. | This includes `appidd` (Application Identification Daemon), `to` (Table of Processes),  `irsd` (Interface Replication and Synchronization Daemon), `lmpd` (Link Management Protocol Daemon),  `jddosd` (Juniper DDOS protection Daemon), `oamd` (Operation, Administration and Maintenance Daemon) |
| T1059.004: Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell | TINYSHELL is able to perform remote file uploads and downloads and establish remote shell sessions. | `tshd_get_file` (Sends a file to the server), `tshd_put_file` (Downloads a file from the server), `tshd_runshell` (Launches an interactive /bin/sh shell session), `tshd_setproxy` (Establish a Socks proxy to a given IP+port number), `tshd_config` (Change Configuration Menu) |
| T1090: Proxy | UNC3886 added a custom command to TINYSHELL to establish a Socks proxy to a given IP+port number | `tshd_setproxy` |
| T1205.002: Traffic Signaling: Socket Filters | The custom `irad` version of the TINYSHELL-based passive backdoor acts as a `libpcap`-based packet sniffer and receives commands by inspecting packets on the wire looking for a magic-string that activates its backdoor capabilities | The malware uses `libpcap` library to capture all network packets on the host. |
| T1095: Non-Application Layer Protocol | The `irad` malware captures all network packets on the host matching a specified BPF filter and reads data from the ICMP packet. The custom `impad` version of TINYSHELL launches an interactive `/bin/csh` session over the UDP connection | The `irad` malware will spawn a listening server on TCP port 31234 (passive mode). The `jdosd` malware binds to UDP port 33512. |
| T1573: Encrypted Channel | The `irad` malware encrypts C2 communications using AES and HMAC. It uses a hardcoded key string to derive session keys. | N/A |
| T1562.003: Impair Defenses: Impair Command History Logging | The custom `impad` version of TINYSHELL was designed to disable all possible logging before the operator connects to the router to perform hands-on activities and then later restore the logs after the operator disconnects. |  It redirects all logging to `/dev/null` and sends a  a HUP (hangup) signal to the `eventd` daemon (which is responsible for logging). |
